# AUSeries
At the moment this file doesn't that much. It will look on "boerse.to" for Series. At the moment I tested just one Uploader called "SerienJK". For others I am not sure if it will work (hope that will change soon). 

That this whole Script will work you have to install the Library Robobrowser (https://robobrowser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

All my further updates I will commit to this Github Repository. I hope I have soon more :)

# What does it to so Far
At the moment it will login to your boerse.to account (for that you have to write your loging datas to the Python File logingdata.py). Then it will search your Request on boerse.to, for example: FILE = 'Hawaii Five 0 S01' / UPLOADER = 'SerienJK' / RESOLUTION = '720' (This three Variable you can change in the Script firstlogingtests.py). After that it will look for the first filecrypt.cc link and will print it out. Thats how far i get. Hope I will push soon some more.
